## Overview
This repository contains a compact analysis of Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) growth for 2024 (quarterly).  
This work was created using Jules (ChatGPT Codex).  
Reference: https://chatgpt.com/codex/tasks  

The analysis uses the provided quarterly values and compares them against the industry benchmark target of **15%**.

### Data
- Q1: 7.31
- Q2: 3.39
- Q3: 6.88
- Q4: 9.06
- **Average:** 6.66

## Key Findings
1. The computed average MRR growth is **6.66%**, well below the target of **15%**.
2. The weakest performance occurred in **Q2 (3.39%)**.
3. Q4 shows modest recovery (9.06%) but still under target.

## Business Implications
- Underperformance may reduce valuation multiples and limit growth capital.
- A weak mid-year quarter suggests potential issues with churn, sales pipeline, or seasonality.

## Recommendations
Primary recommendation: **Expand into new market segments**.  

Specific actions:
1. Launch SMB-focused pricing plans.
2. Enter adjacent geographic markets.
3. Create industry-specific packages.
4. Strengthen upsell and retention strategies.
5. Run structured experiments to improve MRR growth.
